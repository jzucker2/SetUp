# SetUp

This is a resource for my computer setup

Right now this needs work

## Notes

* Here's the [resource about setting up git on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/)
* 

## TODO

- [ ] Remove references to me and make it pluggable and able to reference a private repo with my stuff
- [ ] Make it work with little set up except installing xcode tools
- [ ] First path in python, second pass in bash
